'''9. Student Attendance Eligibility System

A college determines whether a student is eligible to sit for exams based on attendance percentage:

* 75% and above → Eligible
* 60% to 74% → Eligible with warning
* Below 60% → Not eligible

Write a Python program to check eligibility.

Input:
Enter attendance percentage: 58

Output:
Status: Not Eligible
'''
atten=int(input("enter the attendance percentage:"))
if atten>=75:
   print("Eligible")
elif atten>60 and atten<74:
   print("Eligible with warning")
elif atten<60:
   print("Not eligible")
